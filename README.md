# SudokuReactNative
SudokuReactNative is an implementation of Sudoku in React Native.

Sudoku is a logic-based number-placement puzzle, implemented in React Native. The objective of Sudoku is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits, so that each column, each row, and each 3x3 subgrid (or “block”) contain all the digits from 1 to 9, with no repetitions. My application builds a home screen, level selector, designs and implements the gameplay functionality alongside additional features for user experience. I use a variety of tools including React Native, some open-source Javascript libraries, Expo, and Android Studio.

This project was built for CS389D: Mobile Web Development at Pace University.
